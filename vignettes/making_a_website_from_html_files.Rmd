## Introduction

The primary purpose of this package is to provide a way to combine `.html` files scattered throughout a file system into a single website with a hierarchical dropdown menu.
The locations html files are displayed on the website and the hierarchy of the menu itself is determined by the names of the files/directories in html files' path or customized using configuration files.
The benefit of this system is that there are very few restrictions on the layout of the file structure and no knowledge of web design needed. 
This allows HTML notes to provide integrated documentation of a project rather than the documentation enforcing the file structure.
It is so flexible that website can be made for any directory containing `.html` files, regardless if the html files were made for this purpose or not.



## How it works

A single function called `make_website` is given a target directory containing `.html` files and a location to output a website directory. 
In the website directory, a copy of the target directory is made with only the `.html` files and any local files (e.g. images) they reference (via HTML tag attributes like `src` and `href`). 
A `.html` file for each page of the website (i.e. each location in the menu) is then generated for  to display the content of input `.html` files assigned to that location.
Together, the partial copy of the target directory and the page `.html` files constitute a portable website that can be uploaded to a web server.
If the contents of the target directory change the function can be run again to update the website.
