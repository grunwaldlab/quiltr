## What it is

Quiltr is an R package used to combine HTML files scattered throughout a file system into a single website organized by a hierarchical drop-down menu.
It is designed to facilitate embedding notes into computational science projects and making research notebooks.
For this reason, quiltr is most appropriate for creating websites to document projects, where ease of use, transparency, and reliability are the priority.

> Use Quiltr for your lab notebook!


## What it is not

Making simple static websites for other purposes is also possible, but quiltr is not designed to be an all-purpose website generator such as [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) or [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/).
It makes static webpages that have to be rebuilt each time their source changes.


## What it does

Quiltr consolidates any set of HTML files in any directory structure into a website.
All of the raw content of the website, besides the drop down menu and other basic site structure elements, are derived from the HTML files.
The organization of the website and where HTML file content is displayed can be determined by the names of the files/directories or customized using configuration files.
There is also a wrapper function that makes it easy to upload and modify websites on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (where the [documentation](http://grunwaldlab.github.io/quiltr) is hosted).


## Why use it

The benefit of this system is that there are very few restrictions on the layout of the file structure and no knowledge of web design needed beyond the ability to create HTML content (e.g. using Rmd or Word).
[Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is particularly suited to be used with quiltr since it can create HTML from the easily learned Markdown language.
Together, Quiltr and Markdown can be used to create websites without any knowledge of web design or HTML for free on any operating system.
It is so flexible that a website can be made from any directory containing HTML files, regardless if the HTML files or the directory were made for this purpose.


## An example

In the case of documenting computer science projects, the choice of directory structure can be governed by the needs of the project rather than the documentation.
R packages are a good example, in that they require a very specific directory structure, yet should have integrated, easily accessible documentation, such as vingettes. 
Quiltr can be used to consolidate vignettes into a website. 
[This website](http://grunwaldlab.github.io/quiltr) is the result of running the `quilt` function on the Quiltr package source and each page is one of the vignettes you access individually by typing `browseVignettes(package = "quiltr")` into an R terminal. 
A single function call rebuilds the website and uploads it to GitHub pages each time changes are made. 


## Installation

quiltr is an R package available on GitHub, so it can be installed from the RStudio console or an R command line session using the `devtools` command `install_github`.
First, make sure `devtools` is installed:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

Next, install the package from GitHub by entering:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("grunwaldlab/quiltr")
```

The package should now be installed and can be loaded using:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(quiltr)
```
