# Quiltr

Quiltr is an R package currently under development to aid in the creation and maintenance of research notebooks. 
By leveraging the functionality of `knitr`, `git`, and the Bootstrap web framework, this package allows for efficient creation of HTML lab notebooks from notes in Rmd files. 
This facilitates reproducible, version controlled, easily shared research notes/analyses on all major operating systems using free, open source software. 

Currently, the primary focus of the package is automated website creation by combining HTML files scattered throughout a directory structure.
The hierarchical menu of the website can be derived from HTML file names/paths or custom configuration files. 
This is done without imposing/assuming any particular directory structure or HTML syntax, making it extreamly flexible and easy to use. 

## Installation

quiltr is an R package available on GitHub, so it can be installed from the RStudio console or an R command line session using the `devtools` command `install_github`.
First, make sure `devtools` is installed:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

Next, install the package from GitHub by entering:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("grunwaldlab/quiltr")
```

The package should now be installed and can be loaded using:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(quiltr)
```
